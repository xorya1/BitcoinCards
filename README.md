- **Boosters Section:** A special section dedicated to different boosters available in the game.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **CSS:** For styling the application.

- **Ethereum Smart Contracts:** For managing transactions.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BitcoinGame.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd BitcoinGame
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
   Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will launch the app in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Contract Deployment

To use the Bitcoin Game, you need to deploy the smart contract. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Hardhat:**
   If you haven't already, install Hardhat globally:
   ```bash
   npm install --global hardhat
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Hardhat project folder:** (if you have a separate folder for smart contracts)
   ```bash
   cd path/to/hardhat-project
   ```

3. **Deploy the contract:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
   ```
   Replace `<your-network>` with the network you are deploying to (like `localhost`, `rinkeby`, etc.).

4. **Take note of the deployed contract address:** After deployment, you will see the contract address in your console output.

## Updating the Contract Address

After deploying your contract, you need to update the contract address in your application:

1. **Open `App.jsx`:** Find the line where the contract address is defined.

2. **Replace the old contract address:** Update it with your new deployed contract address:
   ```javascript
   const contractAddress = "YOUR_NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"; // Replace this with your new address
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can navigate through different sections:
- **Account:** Manage your account information.
- **Store:** Buy items with your virtual currency.
- **Marketplace:** Trade items with other users.
- **Boosters:** Explore and purchase boosters to enhance your gameplay.
